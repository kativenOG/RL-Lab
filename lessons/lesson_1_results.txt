A) Random Policy on Dangerous Grid World:
[S] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [X] 
[ ] [W] [W] [W] [X] [ ] [X] 
[ ] [ ] [W] [W] [X] [ ] [X] 
[W] [ ] [W] [W] [X] [ ] [X] 
[ ] [ ] [W] [W] [X] [ ] [X] 
[ ] [W] [W] [W] [X] [ ] [X] 
[ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [G] 

Random trajectory generated: 
[(0, 0), (0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 0), (2, 0), (2, 0), (2, 0), (1, 0), (1, 0), (1, 0)]
